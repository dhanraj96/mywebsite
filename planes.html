        <p class="planes">A lesson plan is the instructorâ€™s road map of what students need to learn and how it will be
            done effectively
            during the class time. Then, you can design appropriate learning activities and develop strategies to obtain
            feedback on student learning. Having a carefully constructed lesson plan for each 3-hour lesson allows you
            to enter the classroom with more confidence and maximizes your chance of having a meaningful learning
            experience with your students.</p>
        <h3 class="planes1">A successful lesson plan addresses and integrates three key components:</h3>
        <ul style="list-style: circle;" class="info">
            <li>Learning Objectives</li>
            <br>

            <li>Learning activities</li>
            <br>


            <li>Assessment to check for student understanding</li>
